### Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub Page!
Here you'll have access to my projects and my learning timeline!

## I'm Ruben Albertassi

# Here's some info about me:

I love using codes to help me solve my day-by-day problems. 

I have a degree in Information Systems from Faculdade UGB - Geraldo Di Biase University Center in Volta Redonda-RJ, which led me to fall in love with programming.

I am a student of Software Developer at Trybe, the trybe is a school for people who want to build a successful career in technology.
I believe that people are the key to success and that's why, in addition to dedicating myself to hard skills, I also try to improve my soft skills every day. Therefore, I strongly believe that teamwork and quality work will achieve the best results, faster and healthier in the long run.
